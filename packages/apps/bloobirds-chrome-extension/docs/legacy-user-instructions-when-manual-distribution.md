# Legacy: Installing the Chrome Extension manually

1) Download the extension zip file (link).
2) Unzip the extension and move it somewhere it can stay and won't be changed accidentally. (put an example).
3) Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
4) Enable "Developer mode" clicking on the top right switcher.
5) Click "Load unpacked" and select the extension directory. A new box with the Bloobirds extension should appear after this.

Now the extension is already installed. Click on the puzzle piece button to see the extension icon, you can pin it if you want always to be visible.

Navigate to linkedin.com to start using it.
